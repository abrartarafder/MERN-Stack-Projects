## Backend 

MongoDB -> MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is used as the database component of the MERN stack. MongoDB allows developers to store and retrieve data in a scalable and efficient manner, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data.

Express.js: Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration, making it easier to build server-side applications in the MERN stack. The get and post requests are handled by ExpressJs

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it suitable for building real-time applications. In the MERN stack, Node.js serves as the server-side or back-end component, handling requests, business logic, and data manipulation. Node integrates the database and connects with the backend

## Frontend
React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on creating reusable UI components that efficiently update and render when the underlying data changes. React follows a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build complex UIs by composing smaller, self-contained components. React is used for the client-side or front-end development in the MERN stack. React includes the html and css components for the frontend framework.
